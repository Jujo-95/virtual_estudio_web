Sometimes it may flag semi-transparent garments or certain lingerie photos by mistake. We're continually training the system to improve its accuracy. Image detection issues: If our AI can't identify a full human figure in the on model workflow. For example, if the image is cropped too tightly it may return an unsupported result.
